# Garry's Mod Hook Menu

A Garry's Mod debug addon used to look into your server/client hooks, all in a simple menu!

This is a small addon made by [ItsJustMiaouss](https://github.com/ItsJustMiaouss/hook-menu), all credits goes to him.

# How to use

Just type ``hook_menu`` in your console. You must be a superadmin.

# Warning

It's not recommended to use this addon on your production server: searching for hooks on the server and client side is "extremely" resource intensive!
